   <p id= "me">I am Luzmarie Gonzalez, but since forever i've called mnyself Lucy! I'm from Brooklyn and currently a junior in High school Of Fashion Industires studying to be part of the fashiion marketing world. Im interested in pursuing a carrer in the fashion industry because style determines so much about a person and you're abiliy or limit in creativity. Brands like Gosha and Dime who idenity themselves as streetwear brands and derive from skateboard culture sprang my interest. In my free time I really love to listen to music or attend fashion events, like pop ups, in the ciy.</p>
